This program is supposed to display a 6x3 button array on an ESP32
connected to a display. The display is rotated so that the 6 lines
of 3 buttons are stacked vertically using the long side of the display.
This program does not work, however a very similar program using only 2 buttons
is in a working state in directory ~/hobby_w/ESP32/lvgl_button_test5
rewrite this program so that it works with the working program as a model.
